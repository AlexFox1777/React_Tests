## React testing



 Testing props: As a rule, I divide the testing of the props into two tests: 
 â€” Firstly, check the render of default prop values; when the component is rendered, I expect a value to be equal from defaultPropsin case this prop has defaultProps. 
 - Secondly, check the custom value of the prop; I set my own value and expect it to be received after the render of the component.
